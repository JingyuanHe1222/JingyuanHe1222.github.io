Welcome to Jingyuan He's website:)

I'm currently a master student of the Intelligent Information Systems program at Carnegie Mellon University. 
I received my B.S. in Mathematics-Computer Science from University of California San Diego with Magna Cum Laude honor. 
My academic focus are natural language processing, multimodal machine learning. 
I'm currently exploring multimodal generation with disentangled embeddings and effective dense retrieval (advised by Prof. Chenyan Xiong). 
I'm also very excited about graph theory and stochastic processes as a fan of math.
